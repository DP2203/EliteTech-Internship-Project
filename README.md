## ‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Dashboard (Project 1)-API INTEGRATION AND DATA
VISUALIZATION
A simple command-line weather dashboard using the WeatherAPI.com service. Fetches current weather for any city and visualizes temperature, humidity, and pressure in a bar chart.

**Features:**
- Fetches real-time weather data for any city
- Visualizes temperature (¬∞C), humidity (%), and pressure (mb)
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

**Tech:** Python, requests, matplotlib, seaborn

**How to Run:**
```sh
cd "Project 1"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python weather_dashboard.py
```

---

## üìÑ Weather Report Generator (Project 2)
Generates a comprehensive PDF weather report from a CSV file containing weather data for various cities.

**Features:**
- Reads weather data from CSV
- Calculates summary statistics (avg, min, max)
- Generates a formatted PDF report with bar charts
- Visually appealing layout

**Tech:** Python, matplotlib, fpdf

**How to Run:**
```sh
cd "Project 2"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python weather_report_pdf.py
```

---

## ü§ñ Robo: Command-line Chatbot (Project 3)
An interactive command-line chatbot built with Python and spaCy. Robo can answer questions, tell jokes, solve math problems, provide date/time info, and search Wikipedia.

**Features:**
- Natural language understanding (spaCy)
- Wikipedia search with direct links
- Math problem solving, date/time, jokes, small talk
- FAQ and similarity-based answers

**Tech:** Python, spaCy, wikipedia, scikit-learn

**How to Run:**
```sh
cd "Project 3"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python chatbot.py
```

---

## üìß Spam Email Detection (Project 4)
A comprehensive machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or legitimate using scikit-learn. Includes data preprocessing, multiple ML algorithms, evaluation, and interactive testing.

**Features:**
- Text preprocessing with TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Model evaluation with cross-validation and metrics
- Visualizations and feature importance
- Interactive email testing

**Tech:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**How to Run:**
```sh
cd "Project 4"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spam_detection_model.py
```

---

## üöÄ Challenges & Solutions
- **Data Preprocessing:** Used robust techniques for missing values and encoding.
- **Model Training:** Prevented overfitting with regularization and cross-validation.
- **API/Script Usability:** Designed for easy command-line use and clear outputs.
- **Visualization:** Included charts and reports for better insights.

---

## üîÆ Future Directions
- Expand datasets for deeper insights
- Add web interfaces for user interaction
- Integrate cloud deployment for scalability
- Explore deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
